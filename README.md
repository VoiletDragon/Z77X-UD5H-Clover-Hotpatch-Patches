# Z77X-UD5H-Clover-Hotpatch-Patches

So a friend requested Patches for the Z77X-UD5H. I decided to do ACPI Patching using Clover Hotpatch for this motherboard.

What Works?

USB Power on both USB 2.0 & XHC Controllers,
Ethernet,
Native Powermanagement with IGPU Powermanagement how ever post_install.plist doesn't have edits for iGPU.
Sleep.
